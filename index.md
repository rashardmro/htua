### [MTV's Oddities:The Head](https://archive.org/details/mtvs-oddities-inside-the-head)

This was the first of two series that aired under the banner "MTV's Oddities." The show was created by [Eric Fogel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-fogel-5a328180) (who went on to create "[Celebrity Deathmatch](https://archive.org/details/celebrity_deathmatch_season1)"), and it's set in the same universe as "Beavis and Butt-Head," although it's got a more serious tone and dry sense of humor. The first season is serialized, and was soon followed by "[The Maxx](https://archive.org/details/xxam-maxximized)," a faithful adaptation of a cult comic book. A second season followed, without the serialized format.\

## X-Men - Children Of The Atom (950105 USA)
X-Men: Children of the Atom (Japanese: エックス・メン　チルドレン　オブ　ジ　アトム, Hepburn: Ekkusu Men Chirudoren obu ji Atomu) is an arcade game that was produced by Capcom and released on the CP System II arcade hardware in 1994 in Japan and in 1995 in North America and Europe.

Based on the X-Men comic book, it is the first fighting game produced by Capcom using characters under license from Marvel Comics. Released around the time of the mid-1990s X-Men animated series, the game features voice actors from the series reprising their roles. The game's plot is based on the "Fatal Attractions" story from the comics – players control one of the X-Men or their enemies in their fight against the villain Magneto. They face each of the other characters in the game in best of three one-on-one fighting matches, before battling Juggernaut and Magneto.

The gameplay has much in common with Capcom's previous fighting games, Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Darkstalkers. Children of the Atom adds a combo system that features long combos that can even be performed in mid-air. Also featured in the game are various tactical maneuvers, including the ability for characters to roll. Children of the Atom introduced multi-tiered fighting environments in which the ground would crumble and characters would fall into lower parts of the level. These concepts and the fast pace of the game would provide the basis for Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom series, which started with the game's successor X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

Ports of the game were released for Sega Saturn, PlayStation and personal computer. Of these, the PlayStation version was not as well received as the other versions, suffering from slowdown and missing frames of animation.

### [The Global CTX Mosaic of Mars](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/CTX/index.html)

The Bruce Murray Laboratory for Planetary Visualization has completed a 5.7 terapixel mosaic of the surface of Mars rendered at 5.0 m/px. Each pixel in the mosaic is about the size of a typical parking space, providing unprecedented resolution of the martian surface at the global scale.

We emphasize transparency both in how the mosaic was generated and for users to understand where data in the mosaic come from. We have developed a Python-based pipeline that incorporates non-destructive image processing techniques that preserve all information about the original data that comprise the mosaic and map all seams..

### Excerpt from Genesis Game Guide by The Scribe
Sega's in-house pro football sim - a YACEG series that
                  went with Joe Montana as its spokesman until the 1996
                  release, when the decision was made to use Deion Sanders
                  instead.  The second, NFL Sportstalk Football, was the
                  very first videogame to feature a running commentary, and
                  was the subject of a special feature on the British
                  television program Tomorrow's World. [Read_More](http://backup.segakore.fr/genesiscollective/ShowPage00000000028B686721.htm)
